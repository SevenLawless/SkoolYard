This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Payments (brief)

- When you enroll a student into a class, a pending payment is created automatically for that student with the class fees. The payment links to the student and the class.
- If the student already has a pending payment for that class, no duplicate is created.
- When you unenroll a student from a class, only pending payments for that pair are removed. Paid/cancelled ones remain.

Examples:
- Enroll Alice into "Math 101" (fees $150) → a pending payment of $150 is created for Alice with that class.
- Enroll Alice again into the same class → no new payment is added (already pending).
- Unenroll Alice from "Math 101" → any pending payment for Alice + Math 101 is removed.
